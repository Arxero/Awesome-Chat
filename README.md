# Intro
Awesome Chat is a free web application for online communities and groups. Get it, and your visitors and users can engage with one another in real-time conversation.

# The Purpose
It is intended to be used in an embeddable form just like on our forum http://awesomecs.syntrwave.com. The reason for creating it was to replace the cbox.ws chat that we are using currently with my or better our own thing. A chat where we are able to add features we want and no to be limited by other products that have nothing to do with what we want.

# Deployment
1. Clone it to your GitHub Profile
2. Use https://www.netlify.com in order to host your web application
3. Make an account in https://www.kinvey.com and create your app with the correct collections
4. Add the APP_KEY and APP_SECRET in the project itself and commit the changes to your clone of the app.
5. Embed it in your forum or website.
6. Enjoy!

# The Future
In the current stage of the development is nothing more than proof of concept as it has some bugs and the future is unclear.
